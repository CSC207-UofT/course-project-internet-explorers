Accessibility Report

For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.


Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.


Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
1. 

Principle 1: Equitable Use
All features adhere to the equitable use principle. The game has an equal means of use for all users, as the rules, level difficulties, and controls are consistent throughout all instances of the game. Furthermore, our program does not segregate between users at any point and provisions for security are equal. 
Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The game currently does not offer adaptability to user pace or alternative methods of use. In the future, we could address this design principle by allowing users to use their arrow keys as an alternative to WASD for repositioning. We can further make the game more adaptable to the user’s pace by allowing them to select a level of difficulty based on which the levels would be generated. 
Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Our game’s GUI, HUD, and language is based on several other popular games, allowing for simple and intuitive use. The game allows the user to simply access the user manual, keep track of their progress, and access their inventory, much like they may be accustomed to. Effective feedback is provided at the end of the game with a message that communicates that the game has ended. 
Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Our game maximizes the legibility of essential information by leveraging our HUD where information regarding inventory is written clearly and represented alternatively in pictorial form. However, the game does not allow compatibility for users with sensory limitations. In order to address this in the future, we can add audio directions in the game to help navigate the user. 
Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
All adverse consequences in the game stimulate the user further. As such, this principle of universal design does not directly apply to our game since there doesn’t exist any real hazards that require vigilance. 
Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
Our game requires our user to navigate and control their player with their keyboard. As such, there is low physical effort demanded from the user. Although the controls may be repetitive, they result in several different outcomes depending on the current context of the character. 
Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our game’s intuitive design allows the user to identify important elements such as opponents, inventory, and the map easily. However, our game does not accommodate variations in grip or assistive devices. In the future, this can be addressed by allowing for alternative controls, or inputting controls through a joystick or another device as an alternative to the keyboard. 

2. Our product targets people who enjoy simple and quick games most effectively. Our adventure game would also target avid tower defense game fanatics. These segments prefer games that have simple and intuitive rules, basic control mechanisms, are relatively quick to play, and have minimal story development. We believe our product appeals to such segments as the majority of our features are based on real defense games. These features include the repositioning controls, collision mechanics, and goal of surviving against opponents. 

3. Our program maintains the accessibility of its users as a priority. As such, the game can be played by anyone with a keyboard. As there aren’t any other hardware or software requirements, the game is widely accessible to all demographics from a technology perspective. Culturally, the game is currently only in English and would be less likely used by non-English speakers. Furthermore, our game is less likely to be used by gamers that prefer open-world games, console games, or more developed role playing games.
